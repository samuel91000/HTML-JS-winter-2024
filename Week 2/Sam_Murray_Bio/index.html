        <p>My name is <strong>Samuel Murray</strong>, I was born oct 21 2003. I was born in brattleboro, vt and moved to marlbrough, NH when I was three. From there I did a bit of everything growing up, from basketball and track, to chess and robotics. In high school I got in to computer progaming primarly in <b>c++</b> and <b>c#</b>. At that time I also started competing in the USFA to a limated extent although it didn't last long do to covid. After I graduated high school I took a gap year to work and figure out what I wanted to study for my deploma. During that time I worked a ICU medical as a assembler. Currently I am atending NEIT in pursuit of a <i>cyber sec.</i> deploma.</p>
