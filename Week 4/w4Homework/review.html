            <p>In my opinion <em>Enders Game</em> is one of the better adaptions from books to film that I have seem. It keeps the inpact of the book although it does drop many elaments that may cause probloms is they were to atempt to adapte the rest of the books.</p>
            <p>The largest of these changes and the one that I don't agree with is the cuting of the decusion Ender has with the last queen and the revelation that the formics had atacked earth out of desperation and inresponce he killed all of them.</p>
            <p>One thing I wish they would have added to the film which they plays off of the prior cut but ender disgarding his name and takeing the title of Speaker for the dead as he goes out into the galaxy trying to make amends whith what he has done.</p>

                    <li>Severl props from the film were made with 3D printers</li>
                    <li>Sir Ben Kingsley, as Mazer Rackham who is featured prominently in the movie's marketing, along with the book, doesn't appear until after seventy minutes into the movie.</li>
                    <li>The city featured in the "Never Again" propaganda poster was central Hong Kong.</li>
